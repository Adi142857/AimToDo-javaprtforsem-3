Todo-list-App in short glimspe:

In this Java list tutorial, I will help you understand the characteristics of list collections, how to use list implementations (ArrayList and LinkedList) in day-to-day programming and look at various examples of common programming practices when using lists. By following this tutorial (updated and revised for Java 10) to the end, you will be able to master the List collection in Java.

List is a fundamental and widely-used collection type in the Java Collections Framework. Basically, a list collection stores elements by insertion order (either at the end or at a specific position in the list). A list maintains indices of its elements so it allows adding, retrieving, modifying, removing elements by an integer index (zero-based index; the first element is at 0-index, the second at 1-index, the third at 2-index, and so on). The following picture illustrates a list that stores some String elements:
